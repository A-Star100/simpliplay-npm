# SimpliPlay
It's a cross-platform media player, that's just simple, available on:

- Android
- iOS
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Web
- Google Chrome (Extension)

SimpliPlay can be downloaded at [simpliplay.netlify.app](https://simpliplay.netlify.app/), and this package on npm is an 
**installer** for the desktop version. It doesn't include the software with it so you will need an internet connection for the app to download via the installer.

## Installation
```shell
npm install -g simpliplay
```
*Make sure to install globally if you want to install the app anytime*.

Then:
```shell
simpliplay start
# or
simpliplay update
```
to install SimpliPlay.

To display the current version of the installer, not the app, use:
```shell
simpliplay version
# or
simpliplay ver
```

Thanks for getting almost 1K downloads guys! I hope you enjoy using the app!

**Note:** For simplicity, the installer uses your browser to install the app. If you don't have a default browser set up it may not work properly. If you are having trouble using this package, please either use [our official website](https://simpliplay.netlify.app/#download-options) which will almost always be up to date, or report an issue via the [issue tracker]() for the installer.
